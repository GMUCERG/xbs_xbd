Changes listed in PROT_CHANGES
checksumsmall files from SUPERCOP used instead of checksum128b
Support for AEAD
Commented some debug statements with warnings about I2C to slightly increase
download speed, as that warning is probably AVR specific and likely to be a bug

we checksum all the things for verifiability

objcopy scripts reject .data+.bss > 3/4ths total RAM


SQLAlchemy will duplicate objects if inserted into list and parent is set. We go
w/ consistently having the child set the backreference, also inserting it into
the parent list, as child object often needs the parent upon construction

dirchecksum.py recursively checksums contents of directory


In order to add a new operation, ensure the operation is in OPERATIONS (needs to
conform to the SUPERCOP format). Modify xbxpy/xbx/run_op.py to add an [Operation
Name]Run class using the others as a template, and add to the OPERATIONS
constant at the top of that file. Add a directory in embedded/xbd/xbd_op named
crypto_[operation] and add files to be linked in. See aead and hash for
examples, and examine SUPERCOP
