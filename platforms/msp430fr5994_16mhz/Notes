XBD (FR5994)
	*I2C - P7.1(SCL), P7.0(SDA)
	*Soft Reset -	P6.3
	*Execute Sig. - P7.3		(P5.7)


2 gcc include folders..

Changes:
	c_compilers:		(used by XBS to compile algorithms)
		- changed mcuopts to 5994 
	Makefile:
		- changed general flags
		- need to change BL_ADDR (0x004000 Main: code memory?? not needed same addr.)
	Setting.ini: ??????
		
	global.h:

	XBDDeviceDependent.h:
		- FLASH_ADDR_MIN?? same?	YES
	
	drivers/
		msp430.h -	Replaced file with newer version
				*header needs to be converted make it compatable with gcc sfrw, sfrb..
		legacy.h -	msp430.h dependancy, might not be needed... remove...
		ms430fr5994.h -	Replaced the 5529 specific header
		hardware.h -	Not being used?
		i2cconf.h -	No change needed
		i2c.c:
			- i2cInit()								- DONE
				-configured i2c, set P7.1 and P7.0
			- i2cSetLocalDeviceAddr()						- DONE
				-But ucb2 addr. register not found, used ucb0 instead....
			- i2cSetSlaveReceiveHandler() and i2cSetSlaveTransmitHandler()		- no changes??
				-where are i2c rx,tx ISRs?
			- twi_isr()								- DONE
				-changed register names
		iomacros.h -	Used new iomacros						- DONE
		memory.c -	might have to modify...		(not used)
		in430.h -	might have to modify...
		RS232.c - 	used for debug, needs modification...				- needs MODIFICATIONS
		RS232.h -	header, no changes...
		clock_init.h - 	no changes
		clock_init.c -	needs modifications....						- functions used, needs MODIFICATIONS	
				-modified delay_cycles(), rest modify later

	XBD_HAL.c:
		- XBD_init()									- DONE
			-configure exec,rst pins..
		- XBD_sendExecutionStartSignal()						- DONE
		- XBD_sendExecutionCompleteSignal()						- DONE
		- XBD_programPage()								- DONE but test the func.
			*Use FRCTL_A
		- XBD_busyLoopWithTiming()							- DONE
			*Use RTC_C - need ctr mode
			*32 bit addressable, possible on 5994? RTCNT..
			*why is 8/16 bit overflow needed?
		- soft_reset()									- DONE
			-changed register names
	
	HAL:
		msp430fr5994.ld -	Added file from TI folder, needed?	Yes, used by ./compile.py for algo. (maybe BL makefile too)
			- changed 'RAM' length to full 8k (0x2000, prev. val. 0x1000) and commented out 'LEARAM', 'LEASTACK'
		msp430fr5994_symbols.ld -	Added, msp430fr5994.ld dependency

	bootloader:
		msp430fr5994.ld -	Added file from TI folder, needed?
		msp430fr5994_symbols.ld -	Added, msp430fr5994.ld dependency

	
		

TO DO:	
	- CRC module code??
	- Currently commented out rs232.c and clocks.c (since dev. already runs at 16mhz) and added 'unlock ports' in XBD_init(), modify later
	- setting.ini changes?
	- Makefile - Wrong BL_addr, unable to upload program, change value..


Changes on the XBS side:
		- No changes


-------------------------------------------------------------
Other Notes:

	- flash addr received on I2C from XBH(<-XBS)

	
	XBD_BL.c (->XBD_HAL.c):
		"pfr" -> XBD_BL_HandleProgramFlashRequest():
					- receives flash addr, flash length
		"fdr" -> XBD_BL_HandleFlashDownloadRequest():
					- receives data from XBH, buffers till PAGESIZE, then flashes XBD (i.e itself)
	
	XBH.c:
		"cdr" -> XBH_HandleCodeDownloadRequest() -> "pfr"
	
			
	XBH.py:
		upload_prog -> _upload_code_pages -> "cdr"


	
	How does XBS know where the flash start addr. is for the XBD? xbdprog.hex??
