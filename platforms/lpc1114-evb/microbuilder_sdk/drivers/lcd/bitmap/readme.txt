Bitmap LCDs
===========

This folder contains drivers for 1-bit graphic LCDs (128x64 pixel ST7565, etc.)
or text-only displays.  They are placed in a seperate folder because the
drawing routines are handled quite differently than the generic drawing code
for TFT LCDs.

SSD1306            Driver for 128x64 OLED displays using the SSD1306 controller.
                   Simulates SPI mode using GPIO pins.
ST7565             Driver for  128x64 pixel I2C-based displays (available from
                   Adafruit Industries, for example).  Simulates SPI mode using
                   GPIO pins.
