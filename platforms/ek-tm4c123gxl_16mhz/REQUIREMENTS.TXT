In order to get this hal running, you will need to initialize the hal/tivaware
submodule is checked out and ensure the symlinks in hal/drivers to the
hal/tivaware contents work.

Run git submodule init and git submodule update

Obtain lm4flash and use it to flash the bootloader, or use openocd to do so.
Ensure only one Tiva-C device is plugged in, otherwise edit serial numbers into
the scripts, using lm4flash to obtain them. Be sure to read openocd.cfg

Edit makefile to ensure TARGET_IS_TM4C123_RB1 is defined if using ek-tm4c123gxl
or TARGET_IS_TM4C123_RA1 if using lm4f232, or undefine altogether to not use ROM
functions
