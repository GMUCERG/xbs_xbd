## eXternal Benchmarking eXtension

This work extends the SUPERCOP (http://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html) concepts to facilitate benchmarking external targets. A combination of hard- and software allows for cross compilation with SUPERCOP and execution/timing of the generated code on virtually any kind of device large enough to hold the object code of the algorithm benchmarked plus some space for communication routines and a bootloader.
